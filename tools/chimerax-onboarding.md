# ChimeraX Onboarding For Teammates

You are a new agent or operator who needs to render publication-grade structure figures and videos for a binder-design demo. This is the **single-file brief** that gets you to first render in ~30 minutes. The authoritative reference is [`chimerax-peptide-viz.md`](chimerax-peptide-viz.md); this file points you there with calibration on what matters.

## Why this file exists

A consistent ChimeraX-on-cloud-GPU render pipeline produces visibly higher-quality demo videos than PyMOL on the same inputs. Every new demo follows the same pattern. New teammates burn a day re-discovering the gotchas — this doc collapses them.

## TL;DR

You will:

1. Spin a GPU pod (L40 / L40S is the typical render target) with your operator's network volume mounted at `/workspace`.
2. `apt-get install` ChimeraX from the pre-staged `.deb` on the NV (the UCSF download CGI is JS+cookie gated — there is no headless download path).
3. Drive renders via SSH using ChimeraX command scripts (`.cxc`) wrapped with `xvfb-run` for headless operation.
4. Output: 1600×1600 PNG hero panels + 1080×1080 mp4 spin movies, both with mandatory labels overlaid.

## Where to read deeper

| File | What's in it |
|---|---|
| [`tools/chimerax-peptide-viz.md`](chimerax-peptide-viz.md) | The authoritative cookbook — install recipe, cartoon style, color scheme example, hero recipe, labeled-spin recipe, matchmaker fix |
| [`docs/operational-gotchas.md`](../docs/operational-gotchas.md) | Class #12: UCSF download CGI is JS+cookie gated |

## Install (one-time per pod)

The UCSF ChimeraX download CGI is JavaScript + cookie gated, so `wget` from a fresh pod will silently fail and return JS form HTML instead of the `.deb`. **The `.deb` must be pre-staged on your network volume** by an operator with accepted terms.

```bash
# On a pod with the NV mounted at /workspace
cp /workspace/installers/ucsf-chimerax_<version>_amd64.deb /tmp/
apt-get update -qq
apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends \
  /tmp/ucsf-chimerax_<version>_amd64.deb \
  xvfb libegl1 libglu1-mesa libxkbcommon0 libxcb-xinerama0

# Headless shim (xvfb-run is mandatory on L40 even with --nogui)
cat > /usr/local/bin/chimerax-headless <<'EOF'
#!/usr/bin/env bash
exec xvfb-run -a -s "-screen 0 1920x1920x24" /usr/bin/chimerax --offscreen --nogui --silent "$@"
EOF
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/chimerax-headless
```

If you need a different ChimeraX version, you need a fresh `.deb` re-staged on the NV — there is no non-interactive UCSF download path. Operator pre-stages once; install pods are `cp` + `apt-get install` only.

## The 7 gotchas that bite everyone

| # | Gotcha | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `xvfb-run` is mandatory even with `--nogui` | Wrap into `chimerax-headless` once (see Install) |
| 2 | `2dlabel` placement must precede `movie record` | Add labels first; `2dlabel delete all` after `movie encode` |
| 3 | `modeOldSpline` does not exist in ChimeraX 1.11+ | Use `modeHelix default` (publication look) or `modeHelix tube` (textbook look) |
| 4 | Default `mmaker` fails on divergent structures | `mmaker #2 to #1 cutoffDistance none alg nw ssFraction 0.5 matrix BLOSUM-30` (use `alg sw` for very short peptides) |
| 5 | Supersample 4 quadruples render time | `supersample 4` for hero PNGs (worth it), `supersample 2` for MP4s (4 is prohibitively slow for video) |
| 6 | `alphafold` palette only exists on 1.11+ | `color #2 byattribute bfactor palette alphafold range 50,100`; on older builds, fallback `palette 50,red:70,yellow:90,cyan:100,blue` |
| 7 | UCSF download CGI is JS+cookie gated | Never `wget` from a fresh pod; always pre-stage the `.deb` to NV |

## Mandatory labels checklist

Every demo video should carry clear labels so a non-expert viewer can read what they are seeing without context. Six items per spin movie:

- [ ] **Receptor name + chain ID** (e.g. "<receptor> (chain X)")
- [ ] **Design ID** (arm + index, e.g. "Design #042")
- [ ] **Hotspots targeted** (e.g. "Hotspots: F33 / W36 / W87")
- [ ] **Headline metric** (e.g. "ipSAE_min: 0.78", or "iPTM: 0.65" if a single cofolder is the chosen validator)
- [ ] **Arm + tool source** (e.g. "Arm B · PepGLAD codesign")
- [ ] **pLDDT color legend** (if peptide is pLDDT-colored): "pLDDT: red<50, yellow<70, cyan<90, blue=100" in a fixed corner

The full `2dlabel` recipe is in [`chimerax-peptide-viz.md`](chimerax-peptide-viz.md#spin-movie-recipe--with-labels).

## Standard render pipeline

```
[cofold output PDBs]
   |
   v
ChimeraX render stage
   +- per-design: 1600×1600 PNG (complex view, pLDDT-colored peptide)
   +- per-arm:    3-panel hero figure (receptor / peptide / complex)
   +- per-arm:    6 s spin MP4 with all 6 labels of the top design
   +- capstone:   3 s morph MP4 for state comparison (when applicable)
```

Runs as a stage in the bridge manifest, downstream of cofold + ranking, in parallel with the Rosetta / MolProbity refinement leg.

## Minimal SSH-driven render skeleton

```bash
# On your driving machine:
read IP PORT < /tmp/render_pod_ssh.txt

# Push your cofold output PDB + a .cxc command script to the pod
scp -P $PORT design_042.pdb root@$IP:/workspace/render/
scp -P $PORT render_design_042.cxc root@$IP:/workspace/render/

# Drive the render
ssh -p $PORT root@$IP \
  'cd /workspace/render && chimerax-headless render_design_042.cxc'

# Pull artifacts back
scp -P $PORT root@$IP:/workspace/render/design_042_spin.mp4 .
scp -P $PORT root@$IP:/workspace/render/design_042_hero.png .
```

A working `render_design_NNN.cxc` template is in your last shipped demo's `render/` directory — start from there.

## Cross-team etiquette

- **Don't `pkill chimerax` or `pkill xvfb`** — there may be other agents' render jobs running on the same host. Kill by PID only, derived from your own SSH session.
- **Don't pre-stage a different ChimeraX version** to the NV without telling the operator — it's reused across all demos.
- **Tag your pods with a unique name** (`<demo>-render-<run-id>`) so other agents can filter by name and avoid touching yours.

## Calibration

A "good" demo video should:

- render in <2 min on L40
- be ≤5 MB at 1080×1080 / 30fps / 6s
- have all 6 labels readable on first viewing
- color-resolve the receptor / ligand / hotspots visually
- pop on a white-background HTML page

If yours doesn't, re-read [`chimerax-peptide-viz.md`](chimerax-peptide-viz.md) — the recipes there are the calibrated baseline.

## Gates

- Do not bake gated binaries into a public image by default.
- Reject screenshot-only closeout for real render lanes.
- Keep generated render batches out of git; publish only curated summaries or small reviewed images.
- Pre-stage the ChimeraX `.deb` via an operator-side transfer; the UCSF CGI cannot be reached headlessly.
- Run a currency check before any paid render lane: upstream ChimeraX release notes (new commands, deprecated commands like `modeOldSpline`) and recent rendering / publication-figure preprints. Record the ChimeraX version and the date of the check in the candidate jury.
