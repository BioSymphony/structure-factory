# Tool Cards

These cards describe the Structure Factory tool lanes your agent can compose into a campaign. Each card lists the lane, the runtime gate, the typical inputs and outputs, and the license posture so an agent or operator can decide what to include and what to defer.

Each card follows the same shape:

- Public docs describe the lane and the expected evidence it produces.
- Runtime use needs current primary-source review and the user's intended use context.
- Public images include tools whose redistribution posture has been reviewed.
- License-gated tools install at runtime after the user reviews and accepts their terms. Store private install paths, provider records, accepted-license state, credentials, weights, and generated biological artifacts under ignored runtime storage or in a user-selected artifact store.

The wider tool knowledge base lives in [`references/software-registry.yaml`](../references/software-registry.yaml). Candidate tools that are useful but do not yet deserve a full card are tracked in [`docs/tool-and-skill-radar.md`](../docs/tool-and-skill-radar.md). Cross-cutting contracts cover [confidence sidecars](../docs/confidence-sidecars.md), [scoring invariants](../docs/scoring-invariants.md), and [Boltz template restraints](../docs/boltz-template-restraints.md).

### Antibody Sequence Evolution And Scoring

- [CoSiNE](cosine.md). Antibody affinity maturation as a neural CTMC: sequence-only evolutionary likelihood, zero-shot variant-effect prediction (VEP), and oracle-guided CDR/FR maturation. Structure-free; route candidates through the cofold scoring stack for an orthogonal structural check.

### Multistate And Switch Design

- [SwitchCraft](switchcraft.md). De novo design of state-switching proteins: one sequence, multiple ligand-conditioned conformations (allostery, induced binding, ligand discrimination, small-molecule biosensors). Route every switch through the cofold scoring stack for an orthogonal check.

### Construct Assembly And Multidomain Fusion

- [DOMINO](domino.md). Domain co-occurrence scoring and multidomain sequence generation for fusion constructs downstream of a validated binder. Adjacent to the binder stack, not a binder designer; upstream license unresolved at review.

- [Protenix](protenix.md). Biomolecular complex prediction; Protenix-v2 is the exact published binder-study scoring variant.

## Stack Pattern

A common end-to-end binder campaign:

```text
target prep
  -> designer (RFdiffusion3 | RFpeptides | HelixDiff | PepGLAD | EvoBind | Genie3)
  -> sequence design (ProteinMPNN or SolubleMPNN)
  -> foldability/uncertainty review (ESMFold2 where useful)
  -> cofold slate (Boltz + Chai-1 + AF2-Multimer + optional OpenDDE)
  -> ipSAE rescore on PAE matrices
  -> consensus gate
  -> refinement
  -> rendered report
```

The cofold scoring stack card explains how to compose Boltz, Chai-1,
AF2-Multimer, and optional OpenDDE into the validator slate.

## Important Context

- iPTM alone is increasingly deprecated for binder ranking. Recent benchmarks prefer ipSAE and multi-validator consensus over single-cofolder iPTM.
- Wet-lab confirmation lives downstream of every card here. The cards describe in silico triage and provenance, not binding proof.
- For each new target, start with a target-prep step that pins accession, chain, hotspots, and uncertainty. The designer arms expect this target-window file as input.
