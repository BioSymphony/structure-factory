# Task Packs

Task packs are tracker-neutral work bundles for agents. They can be imported into Linear, GitHub Issues, Notion tasks, or another queue after public validation.

Current pack:

- `task-packs/binder-design-fast-path-v0/` - four-task binder-design scaffold covering target/window setup, generation readiness, cofold ranking, and report review.

Public task packs should include:

- routing label `sym:structure-factory`
- result boundary
- exact public inputs
- expected artifacts
- owned paths
- dependencies
- risk notes
- validation commands
- `<!-- symphony:schema -->` block

Do not put private tracker IDs, private URLs, provider credentials, private data, or live run logs in a public task pack.

## How To Use A Pack

1. Read the pack README or `pack.yaml`.
2. Validate the source campaign or example:

```bash
bsf validate examples/pd-l1-binder-design-public
```

3. Generate tracker-neutral drafts:

```bash
bsf issue-dry-run examples/pd-l1-binder-design-public --out .runtime/pd-l1-issues
```

4. Review the drafts before importing them into Linear, GitHub Issues, Notion, or another tracker.
5. Keep cloud or GPU issues in backlog until an operator-gated runtime packet exists outside public git.

For the broader workflow, see [`../docs/workflow-map.md`](../docs/workflow-map.md) and [`../docs/linear-orchestration.md`](../docs/linear-orchestration.md).
