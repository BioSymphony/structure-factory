# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Corrected ESMFold2 fresh-install readiness: the registry now points to stable
  `esm==3.4.1.post1`, and the legacy full/Fast wrappers are marked
  `adapter_required` until ported and dry-run against the current interface.
- Added public tool cards for BioNeMo Inference Runtime, SimpleFold-Turbo, and
  PATCHR, plus scoring-invariant and Boltz template-restraint guidance.
- Documented OpenFold3 v0.5.0 and its OpenBind v0 default parameters, including the structure-prediction and affinity boundary and the distinction from the OpenBind benchmark dataset.

## 0.1.0 - 2026-09-01

- Added an early Claude/Anthropic binder-study entry point to the README and linked the skill, round guide, and decision loop across newcomer documentation.
- Added Apple SimpleFold as a public, machine-selectable monomer structure and conformational-ensemble predictor with model variants, runtime bindings, source and model-license distinctions, and an explicit cofold boundary.
- Covered the advertised FAL, Modal, Lambda Cloud, and RunPod provider-run identities.
- Added bounded run authorization, a synthetic round-history example, and platform-skill closeout guidance.
- Aligned ESMFold2 and closeout guidance with the checked runtime contracts.

- Reframed the README, agent skills, AGENTS guide, FAQ, glossary, and tool cards to lead with what users and their agents can run, rather than what the repo is not.
- Added a public README banner and 1280 x 640 social preview asset under `docs/assets/`.
- Added `bsf catalog` (JSON and Markdown) and wired it into the Make targets and skill files.
- Added new tool cards for Boltz, Chai-1, and ProteinMPNN drafted from upstream sources, plus a `Hand A Mission To An Agent` section to every existing tool card.
- Added `docs/faq.md` and `docs/glossary.md` so newcomers and general-purpose agents have a starting place for jargon and common questions.
- Added compact synthetic schema examples for result and workflow records.
- Added Lambda Cloud and Modal as first-class remote compute paths alongside RunPod and AWS Batch: added public-safe provider profiles under `modules/provider-profiles/lambda/` and `modules/provider-profiles/modal/`, taught the provider and module-manifest validators about the new providers and the `serverless_function` class, listed them in `sidecar.yaml`, and documented each path across `docs/compute-backends.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `README.md`, the ESMFold2 tool card, and the system-context diagram.
- Generalized the in-pod repo-checkout default to `/workspace/repo` (matching the network-volume bootstrap convention, and kept distinct from the `/workspace/structure-factory` volume root) across the RunPod entrypoints and scope check, and dropped the old repo name from the sidecar workflow-template filename.
- Deduplicated the provider allowlists into a shared `scripts/structure_factory/provider_policy.py` imported by both `provider_profile_check.py` and `module_manifest_check.py`, so the two validators use the same policy.
- Added two tool cards: `tools/cosine.md` (CoSiNE, antibody affinity maturation as a neural CTMC: sequence-only evolutionary likelihood, zero-shot variant-effect prediction, and oracle-guided maturation) and `tools/esmfold2-binder-controls.md` (sequence, structure, interface, logit, and optimization controls for constraining ESMFold2/Biohub binder-design runs); indexed both in `tools/README.md`.
- Refreshed the `docs/tooling-and-licensing.md` design lane: added AlloGen (Hugging Face Apache-2.0 metadata vs MIT `LICENSE` split), sharpened RFdiffusion (BSD plus dependency/commit/weight-hash review) and Chai-1 (Apache-2.0, pin and MSA-server posture), pinned Boltz to PyPI 2.2.1, and noted CoSiNE (MIT, GPU-only install).
- Added the public binder-lane workflow for multi-arm study-shape replay, tool substitution, scientific and license constraints, per-stage local/API/cloud routing, hash-bound execution handoffs, and an offline synthetic contract check.
- Made Anthropic-style replay machine-checkable at the selected stage boundary, including exact generator, sequence-designer, predictor, scorer, and model-variant identities; preserved workflow-shape replay and explicit swap arms as separate strategies.
- Refreshed the public binder cohort with current primary-source records for ESMFold2, ProteinMPNN, Protenix v2, PXDesign, Proteina-Complexa, and FreeBindCraft, removing stale universal blockers while retaining route-specific terms and runtime checks.
- Clarified the end-user decision path across target and site, platform-skill/API/self-hosted routes, local and cloud providers, budget, rounds, optimization metric, stopping rule, adapter dry-runs, and artifact closeout.
- Tightened the README, binder guides, runtime-readiness note, agent skill, and operator runbook; removed repeated workflow summaries and blanket approval language while preserving release and cleanup terms.

## 0.1.0-alpha.0 - 2026-05-13

- Added tracker-neutral task pack for the binder-design fast path.
- Added RunPod-first launch templates, stage contracts, and provider docs.
- Added dependency-free public validator and audit CLI.
- Added `make harness-check`, `make release-check`, and optional `make secret-scan` gates.
