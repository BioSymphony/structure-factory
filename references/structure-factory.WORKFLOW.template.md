## Public Operator Prerequisites

This template is a public starting point. Before using it with a real
orchestrator, replace the project slug, branch/ref, workspace root, and Codex
home placeholders with operator-owned values.

Required outside this repo:

- Linear API key or another tracker adapter
- Symphony workspace root
- Codex home for worker sessions
- pushed public repo ref for workers to clone
- private/operator-gated provider launcher for any paid cloud mutation

Without that private/operator stack, use this file as a workflow shape only and
run the local CLI/Make checks directly.

You are working on Linear issue {{ issue.identifier }} for BioSymphony Structure Factory.

Title: {{ issue.title }}

Body:
{{ issue.description }}

## Required behavior

- Read `AGENTS.md`, `README.md`, and relevant campaign/module docs before editing.
- Use `skills/biosymphony-structure-factory/SKILL.md` as the repo-local agent-instruction entry point when relevant.
- Keep changes bounded to the issue `## Touched Areas`.
- Do not launch RunPod, local heavy jobs, SSH/HPC jobs, cloud/neocloud instances, download raw EMPIAR data, install restricted tools, or write secrets from the worker shell. For authorized RunPod smokes, validate and prepare a launch request marker for trusted host-side closeout.
- Run validation commands exactly as written.
- Treat RunPod as the default reviewed remote path, but keep campaign science provider-neutral and preserve input-audit plus contract-self-check gates for every backend.
- Use `$symphony-linear` for Linear comments, state changes, and handoff metadata.
- Move completed non-RunPod prep issues directly to `Done` after self-review and validation. For trusted RunPod smokes, do not move the issue to `Done`; the host-side `after_run` closeout owns the final state after artifact proof and cleanup.
- Write `.symphony-runpod-launch-request.json` only after local validation passes. It must include issue identifier, manifest path, max spend, requested action `create_verify_cleanup`, and result boundary.
- Post a final Linear comment with a `<!-- symphony-outcome -->` block containing status, files touched, validation summary, and suggested action.
