# Claim Ledger

## Allowed Statements

- This is a public-safe campaign scaffold for PD-L1 binder-design triage.
- The target context is derived from public PDB accession `4ZQK`.
- The example candidate jury is synthetic and demonstrates schema shape.
- A real run would need GPU execution, artifact hashes, and scientist review before interpreting candidates.

## Disallowed Statements

- A candidate binds PD-L1.
- A candidate blocks PD-1.
- A candidate is selective.
- A candidate is safe.
- A candidate is therapeutic.
- A candidate should be synthesized or tested without separate expert review and authorization.

## Closeout Rule

If target intake, runtime gate, generation, cofold jury, artifact hashing, or claim audit fails, close as `blocked`, `partial`, or `insufficient_evidence`. Do not mark the campaign successful because infrastructure started.
