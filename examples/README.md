# Examples

Each example folder contains a public, lightweight campaign manifest and the expected artifact contract that goes with it. Point your agent at one of these to learn the shape of a campaign before scaffolding your own.

Example folders stay lightweight by design. Raw datasets, maps, particle stacks, private structures, generated structures, provider logs, and model weights live in operator-controlled infrastructure outside the repo.

| Example | Best First? | Time | Use Case | Command | Result Boundary | What You Learn |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `pd-l1-binder-design-public` | Yes | 5 minutes | Binder-design fast path from public interface metadata | `bsf validate examples/pd-l1-binder-design-public` | `computational_candidate` | target-window file, stage contract, candidate ranking contract, validation notes |
| `standalone-local-binder-design` | Yes | 15 minutes | No-private-infrastructure starter path | see folder README for copy-paste command | `planning` | local scaffold and tracker-neutral task drafts |
| `screening-superpowers` | After quickstart | 30 minutes | Local screening fixture and fanout contracts | `make screening-check` | `public_synthetic_demo` | fixture screening outputs, fanout estimate, schema checks under `.runtime/` |
| `empiar-10204-v0` | After quickstart | 5 minutes | Metadata-only CryoCore handoff example | `bsf validate examples/empiar-10204-v0` | `public_demo` | public accession manifest, handoff gates, and expected downstream artifacts |
| `orchestration-fixtures` | Advanced | 30 minutes | Advanced schema fixtures for screening/design orchestration | `make screening-schema-check` | `public_synthetic_demo` / `planning` | schema-valid JSON fixtures |

New examples should start in `.runtime/` via `bsf scaffold-campaign`, then move under `examples/` only after public-release review.

Note: a few screening and artifact schemas retain legacy internal status values such as `candidate` and `processed`. Public campaign manifests and newcomer-facing docs should use `planning`, `public_demo`, `public_synthetic_demo`, `computational_candidate`, `blocked`, or `insufficient_support`.
