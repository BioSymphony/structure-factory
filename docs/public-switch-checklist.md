# Public Switch Checklist

Last reviewed: 2026-05-24

This checklist is for turning the local public export into a public repository. It assumes the repo stays local until the owner explicitly adds a remote and pushes.

## Local Release Gate

Run:

```bash
make public-switch-check
make clean
make harness-check
make public-audit
```

Expected state:

- The public harness, public audit, tests, module checks, provider profile checks, RunPod template checks, issue checks, screening fixture checks, and contract self-check pass.
- `make secret-scan` reports no leaks when `gitleaks` is installed; otherwise it is recorded as an optional skipped local tool.
- `.runtime/`, cache folders, and generated local outputs are absent after `make clean`.
- `git ls-files` contains no raw structures, maps, archives, videos, model weights, `.local.json` summaries, generated report books, or private runtime outputs.

## Privacy And Security Gate

Before push, verify:

- No private workstation paths, private user names, private tracker URLs, concrete provider IDs, private registry names, or accepted-license records are present.
- RunPod public templates are non-launchable. Real provider packets with embedded payloads, concrete placement, real approvals, raw-download authorization, or provider secrets stay outside git.
- Public docs use environment variable names and placeholders only. Secrets, tokens, license files, signed URLs, installer links, and provider credentials are never committed.
- Raw cryo-EM movies, private structures, unpublished sequences, private ligand libraries, generated candidate structures, and large public datasets remain outside git.

## History Gate

The public switch should not publish private history. Use one of these paths:

- Create a clean root commit from the scrubbed working tree.
- Use a deliberate history rewrite or squash that removes private and generated artifacts from all reachable commits.
- Recreate the public repo from the cleaned tree and verify the first public commit contains only intended public material.

Staged deletions are not enough if old commits remain reachable on the future public remote.

## Remote Gate

Only after the owner confirms the final repository name and visibility:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/BioSymphony/biosymphony-structure-factory-public.git
git push -u origin main
```

Do not push while the repo still points at a placeholder remote, a private remote, or no-confirmation organization target.

## Provider Gate

Local public readiness is not remote execution readiness. A real RunPod, AWS, HPC, or neocloud run still requires:

- a pushed public 40-character commit SHA
- digest-pinned or reviewed runtime image posture
- current license/use-context review for gated tools
- explicit operator authorization with budget, runtime cap, and cleanup policy
- expected artifacts, hash checks, progress ledger, and terminal closeout state
